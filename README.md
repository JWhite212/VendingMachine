# VendingMachine
A vending machine project modelled in Java, aimed at showcasing strong design principles, and clear, well-documented, and thoroughly tested code. The project aimed to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The vending machine functionality involves:
+ The machine accepts British pound sterling in the form of coins.
+ The machine contains a variety of drinks and snacks.
+ Users may deposit coins into the machine.
+ Once a sufficient amount of money has been deposited, users may withdraw a drink or snack of their choice.
+ Users may cancel their purchase and withdraw the money they have deposited.
+ Once a drink or snack has been purchased, the remaining change is returned to the user.
+ The owner of the vending machine can add new contents and deposit/withdraw money.
